Resources for this assignment:
5.Task 1:
Use the IN operator to select all individuals from the â€œemployeesâ€ table, whose first name is either â€œDenisâ€, or â€œElvisâ€.
Task 2:
Extract all records from the â€˜employeesâ€™ table, aside from those with employees named John, Mark, or Jacob.
6.Working with the "employees" table, use the LIKE operator to select the data about all individuals, whose first name starts with "Mark"; specify that the name can be succeeded by any sequence of characters.
Retrieve a list with all employees who have been hired in the year 2000.
Retrieve a list with all employees whose employee number is written with 5 characters, and starts with "1000"
7.Select all the information from the "salaries" table regarding contracts from 66,000 to 70,000 dollars per year.

Retrieve a list with all individuals whose employee number is not between "10004" and "10012".

Select the names of all departments with numbers between "d003" and "d006".
8.Retrieve a list with data about all female employees who were hired in the year 2000 or after.

Hint: If you solve the task correctly, SQL should return 7 rows.

Extract a list with all employees' salaries higher than $150,000 per annum.
9.Obtain a list with all different "hire dates" from the "employees" table.

Expand this list and click on "Limit to 1000 rows". This way you will set the limit of output rows displayed back to the default of 1000.

In the next lecture, we will show you how to manipulate the limit rows count.
10.How many annual contracts with a value higher than or equal to $100,000 have been registered in the salaries table? How many managers do we have in the â€œemployeesâ€ database? Use the star symbol (*) in your code to solve this exercise.
11.Select all employees whose average salary is higher than $120,000 per annum.

Hint: You should obtain 101 records.

Compare the output you obtained with the output of the 
following two queries:

SELECT

*, AVG(salary)

FROM

salaries

WHERE

salary > 120000

GROUP BY emp_no

ORDER BY emp_no;


SELECT

*, AVG(salary)

FROM

salaries

GROUP BY emp_no

HAVING AVG(salary) > 120000;
13.Select the first 100 rows from the 'dept_emp' table.
14.Create a new department called "Business Analysis". Register it under number "d010".
